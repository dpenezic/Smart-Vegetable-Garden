Smart Kitchen Garden using Internet of Things
(Now, everyone can grow)
1.	Introduction 
Vegetables are an important part of human diet which are consumed daily in different forms. Increasing population is exerting pressure day by day on available limited food supply. In Pakistan, presently vegetables are being grown on an area about 0.69 million hectares with a total production of 8.4 million tons annually ultimately per capita availability (137 g/man/day) is less than international health standards (300 g/man/day) [1]. Many people have garden in homes and commercial buildings. If people grow daily usage vegetables in these gardens then it will help to cope with the above mention problem also well maintained garden can enhance beauty of house or building.
A lot of people refuse gardening because the maintenance of gardens is a cumbrous task because gardens requires continuous observation and monitoring throughout the life of plants. Due to which it is a major hurdle for peoples to undertake gardening alongside their routine work. Most of the peoples also do not have much knowledge that how to grow plants in appropriate way.

The proposed system overcomes the monitoring problem and help for growing vegetable plants. By using proposed system a user can monitor garden remotely from any location around the globe through internet. The system will also analyze data about plants to wisely provide guidelines for better production and protection.
2.	Problem in Existing System
There exist different systems for gardening but they are not much sufficient for real time monitoring and they are also not intelligent to provide guide to increase throughput and yield [2] [3] [4].
There are some weak points in existing systems as these systems are either too expensive, not compatible with an application or both, due to lack of real time monitoring these systems are no more than a planner or reminder and are not intelligent enough that may learn itself and will provide user tips about gardening that how to protect and enhance them.

2.1.	Background study 
As there are different systems that implement least but not all the features of the purposed system. After exploring the existing systems we have found the following systems with lacks. 

GreenIQ [3]
This system, measure the volumetric water content in soil and weather forecasting to generate schedule irrigation of garden the system sensors were controlled through an android application over internet from anywhere but there is a lack of intelligent guidelines.

GardenPi [2] 
The GardenPi [2] monitoring and watering the garden automatically. This system had watering on the base of Forecast and timer. But the new system will use the sensor for temperature, soil moisture, light and humidity .On the base of that information the new system will be able to make better watering decision. The data will be available via onboard website or mobile application.

Hydro Mazing Smart Gardening System [4]
The hydroMazing [4] controls and manages your growing environment by controlling fans, heaters, lights, and water pumps and it works under fully controlled environment.

DIY Gardening [5]
This application give gardening tips such as garden design tricks how to protect vegetables, how to decorate garden and just how to water plants the right way. There is no monitoring and remote controlling also give just generic predefined guidelines not on real situation of plants and environment. 
3.	Proposed System
Conditions in your garden are constantly changing. Know what’s happening in real time so you can keep your plants healthy. The Smart Kitchen Garden tracks light, humidity, temperature, soil moisture from sensors and then cross-references this information through Wi-Fi with plant databases on server, and the nearest weather station to give customized gardening guidance about irrigation and plants health on smartphone through application.
This is what it means "Your Garden just got smarter!

Due to vast nature of different plants species and variance in environment to provide proper guideline different reports [6] [7] [8]related to system are explored. As accurate data through credible resources is not available. To make system work properly there is a need to quantify the data, for this purpose some limited number of vegetable chosen for modeling the system and small research survey will be conducted at local zone to accurately predict vegetables requirement so that system can guide user more precisely.

The selected vegetables required in small quantity in our kitchen but are more usable as supportive vegetables. Without these vegetables dishes are incomplete & can be grown even in pots and baskets. These vegetables includes coriander, onion, garlic, green chili, mint, radish, carrot, tomato. 
4.	Main Modules    
The best way for the user to monitor the garden would be through a mobile application. For this we are going to develop an android application because of its 86.8% global market share [9]. Following are some key modules of the system.

4.1.	Intelligent Guide
This module is an intelligent agent which will be trained with data set gathered from sensors and some standard information about plant through research survey, then it will match between the plant’s currents and predefined state to provide customized gardening guidance such as which fertilizer to be use, when to trim, estimated time to harvest, is the season is appropriate to germinate desired plant and appropriate schedules for irrigation.

4.2.	Remote monitoring:
Monitor and interact with your plants in real time right from your smartphone .This module collect the data from sensors and saves it on the server so that it will be available online to make it ready for user to monitor and control garden from anywhere.

5.	Expected Outcome
The major focus of developing this system is to make our ecosystem healthy through grabbing the intention of people towards gardening by making it smarter as well as time and cost effective.
Following are some major expected out comes.
 
5.1.	Reduce cost & power consumption 
The proposed system will be able to plan the proper watering schedule intelligently. As the system utilizes the electricity only when required, to reduce power consumption it will also suggest fertilizer usage & other required maintenance on the basis of analyzed data so it will ultimately reduce cost. 
5.2.	Increase garden productivity
As system is providing the most essentials of plants meanwhile such as when to water them and when fertilizer to be used, so it will eventually increase the yield of garden. To get the maximum plant productivity, Smart kitchen gardening is suitable solution.
5.3.	Provide healthy vegetables on a door step
Smart kitchen gardening also has a potential for healthy food. The obvious advantage is pesticide free production and availability at door step.
